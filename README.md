# Artificial Intelligence Agentic Auditing Tutorial

![Symposium Banner](banner.jpg)

Welcome to the **Artificial Intelligence Agentic Auditing** tutorial, part of the [63rd World Continuous Auditing and Reporting Symposium (WCARS)](https://raw.rutgers.edu/63wcars.html) at [Rutgers Business School](https://www.business.rutgers.edu/) in Newark on November 7th, 2024. This tutorial will provide an in-depth, hands-on exploration of how AI agents can be leveraged to enhance and automate various auditing tasks. ü§ñüîç

This tutorial covers how multiple AI agents can work collaboratively to audit accounting journal entries, simulating tasks typically performed by human auditors. This session explores the growing role of **Agentic Auditing**, where autonomous AI agents work together to perform anomaly detection, compliance verification, and approval flow analysis. üêçüíª
