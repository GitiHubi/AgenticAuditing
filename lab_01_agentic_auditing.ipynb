    "Our lab environment is based on `Jupyter Notebooks` (https://jupyter.org/), which provide an interactive platform for performing a variety of statistical evaluations and data analyses. In this lab, we will explore how to apply **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, specifically using the `crewAI` framework, to perform automated auditing tasks. The objective is to leverage multiple AI agents that can collaboratively analyze accounting journal entries, simulating the work of human auditors. This approach is based on the concept of **Agentic Auditing**, where specialized AI agents are assigned distinct tasks, such as anomaly detection, compliance verification, and approval flow analysis. Each agent operates autonomously but works as part of a team, ensuring that audit processes are thorough and efficient."
